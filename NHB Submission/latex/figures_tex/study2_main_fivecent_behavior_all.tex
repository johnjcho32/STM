  \caption{Difference in messenger and non-messenger ratings of the Behavioral Index by losing (STM) and winning (RTM) across unrelated fate, shared fate, opposite fate conditions, Study 2 (including 5 and 50 cent differences). 
  \textit{Note: OLS regression with robust standard errors, with error bars representing 95\% confidence intervals.In the behavioral index, the DV is calculated by averaging the standardized scores of the dictator game, spin the wheel task, and prisoner's dilemma. The \$0.05 Shared Fate (Panel A) and \$0.50 Shared Fate (Panel B) conditions are when the partner wins \$0.05 or \$0.50, respectively, when the respondent wins. The Unrelated Fate (Panel C) condition is when the partner winnings are unrelated to the respondent winning. The \$0.05 Opposite Fate (Panel D) and \$0.50 Opposite Fate (Panel E) conditions are when the partner wins \$0.05 or \$0.50, respectively, when the respondent loses.}}
