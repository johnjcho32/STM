\caption{Survey Flow of Study 1 and 2.\label{fig:survey-flow} \textit{Note:} 1/3 of attitude measures were asked after receiving the message in Part 1, while the other 2/3 were asked after Part 2. In our analysis, we group whether attitude measures were asked before or after Part 2. Subjects learn results of behavioral games after all outcome variables (behavioral and attitudes) are concluded.}
