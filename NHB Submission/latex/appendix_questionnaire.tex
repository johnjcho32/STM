\subsubsection*{3. Instructions}
Please read these instructions carefully. You will complete a brief
comprehension quiz after each part of these instructions and you will earn an
additional \$.05 bonus for each quiz question you get right. 

\begin{description}[listparindent = 1.5em]
\item[Overview Instructions] \hspace{1cm}

Today you will earn 50 cents for participating in this task. You
will also have the opportunity to earn additional money based on how you do on
quizzes about these instructions as well as your and other participants'
decisions. This additional money will be paid to you as an MTurk bonus in the
next two weeks. 

Today's task is divided into three parts. We will describe \textbf{part
1} now, and then tell you about \textbf{parts 2 and 3} later.

\item[Part 1 Instructions: \{\$Task1\} task] \hspace{1cm}

In \textbf{part 1}, you will be randomly paired
with another human participant in this task who has the role of \textbf{messenger}. 

You
will then perform a \textbf{\{\$Task1\} task} where you \{\$Task1short\}. \{\$Task1long\}. You
will have 15 seconds to make your decision.

The \textbf{messenger} will then tell you the
outcome of the \{\$Task1\} task. If you \{\$Task1Correct\}, you will earn an additional
\textbf{25 cent bonus}. Otherwise, you earn \textbf{nothing}. 

Your partner will observe
\{\$Task1observer\}. They will communicate the outcome to you by clicking a button
that sends a standard message with the result. Specifically, if your \{\$Task1noun\}
is correct, you will receive this message: \{\$Task1CorrectMsg\}. If your
\{\$Task1noun\} is incorrect, you will receive this message: \{\$Task1IncorrectMsg\}.

Once you have finished reading these instructions, please proceed to the
3-question comprehension quiz on the next {screen}. For each question you get
right, you will earn \$.05.

\item[Part 1 Quiz Question 1] \hspace{1cm}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Nothing. 
    \item \$0.25 no matter what. 
    \item It depends on whether you \{\$Task1correct\}.
    \item It depends on whether your partner decides to send you a bonus.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Feedback: \{Correct/Incorrect.\} Your part 1 bonus depends on whether you
\{\$Task1correct\}. If you do so, you will earn \$0.25.

do you choose? Select the ``Left'' or ``Right'' button to continue. 

You have 15
seconds to decide or you cannot earn a bonus.

\subsubsection*{6. Part 1, message}

(Make the participant wait 30 seconds before this screen appears) 

The
\textbf{messenger} has sent you this message: 

\{If correct\}: \{\$Task1CorrectMsg\}

\{If
incorrect\}: \{\$Task1IncorrectMsg\}

\begin{description}[listparindent = 1.5em]
    \item[Part 2 Instructions] \hspace{1cm}
    
    Now it is time for \textbf{Part 2} of this task. 
    
    In part 2, you will play three
    games with \{\$Task2PartnerLong\}. Additionally, you will answer some survey
    questions. 
    
    We will describe each of the three games before you play them.
\end{description}

\begin{description}[listparindent = 1.5em]
    \item[Allocation game:]  \hspace{1cm}
    
    In the allocation game, we will give you an extra \$.50. You will decide
    how to allocate this extra money. Specifically, you can keep it all, or you
    can give some or all of it to your partner. Any money you keep will be given
    to you as a bonus, while any money you share will be given to
    \{\$Task2PartnerShort\} as a bonus. 
    
    You will indicate your choice by moving a
    slider that shows how much you wish to give to your partner. 
    
    [Slider label:
    How much of your \$.50 do you wish to give to your partner,
    \{\$Task2PartnerShort?\}]
\end{description}

\begin{description}[listparindent = 1.5em]
    \item[Spin the wheel game:] \hspace{1cm}
    
In the spin the wheel game, you have the chance to win an additional
    \$0.50 if you predict the outcome of a wheel spin correctly.  
      
    The wheel has ten
    numbers and only one number is the winning one. You pick a number, and if
    the wheel stops at that number, you earn extra \$0.50. Otherwise, you do not
    earn any extra money. We will communicate to you the result of the wheel
    spin at the end of this task. 
    
    You cannot spin the wheel yourself, however.
    Instead, you have to decide who spins the wheel on your behalf. 
    
    Specifically,
    you will have to choose whether you want the computer or your partner,
    \{\$Task2PartnerShort\}, to spin the wheel. 
    
    Do you prefer that the computer or
    your partner, \{\$Task2PartnerShort\}, spin the wheel? 
    
    \{``Computer'' /
    ``Partner''\}
\end{description}

\begin{description}[listparindent = 1.5em]
    \item[Directions game:] \hspace{1cm} 
    
    In the directions game, you can win up to extra \$0.50 depending on the
    decisions that you and your partner, \{\$Task2PartnerShort\}, will make. 
    
    You and
    your partner must choose whether to go up or down. 
    
    If you choose to go \textbf{up}:
    
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item and your partner also chooses to go up, each of you gets \$0.40.
    	\item and your partner chooses to go down, you get nothing and your
    partner gets \$0.40.
    \end{itemize}

    If you choose to go \textbf{down}:
    
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item and your partner chooses to go up, you get \$0.40 and your partner
    gets nothing.
    	\item and your partner also chooses to go down, each of you gets \$0.10.
    \end{itemize}

    You and your partner will choose without knowing each other's choice.

    Which direction do you choose? 
    
    \{``Up'' / ``Down''\}

    \item[Part 2 Quiz Question 1] \hspace{1cm}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item True or false: In part 2, you partner is
        \{\$Task2PartnerShort\}?
        \begin{itemize}

        \item In the allocation game, what happens to any of the \$.50 you decide to keep?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It is paid to me as a bonus.
            \item It is paid to my partner as a bonus.
            \item Nothing, it simply disappears.            
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

    Feedback: \{Correct/Incorrect.\} In part 2, any money you decide to keep
    is paid to you as a bonus, while any money you give to your partner is paid
    to them as a bonus.

    \item[Part 2 Quiz Question 3] \hspace{1cm}
    \begin{enumerate} \setItemnumber{3}
        \item In the spin the wheel game, who spins the wheel whose outcome you are trying to predict?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I spin the wheel.
            \item The computer always spins the wheel.
            \item My partner always spins the wheel.
            \item I decide whether the computer or my partner spins the wheel.                   
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

    Feedback: \{Correct/Incorrect.\} You decide whether your partner or the

            \item If \{\$Task2PartnerShort\} also chooses to go up, each of you gets \$0.40. 
            \item You get nothing regardless of what \{\$Task2PartnerShort\} chooses.
            \item You get \$0.10 and \{\$Task2PartnerShort\} gets \$0.40.

decisions. This additional money will be paid to you as an MTurk bonus in the
next two weeks. 

Today's task is divided into three parts. We will describe \textbf{part
1} now, and then tell you about \textbf{parts 2 and 3} later.

\item[Part 1 Instructions: \{\$Task1\} task] \hspace{1cm}

In \textbf{part 1}, you will be randomly paired
with another MTurk participant in this task who has the role of \textbf{messenger}. 

You 
will then perform a \textbf{\{\$Task1\} task} where you \{\$Task1short\}. \{\$Task1long\}. You
will have 15 seconds to make your decision. 

The \textbf{messenger} will then tell you the
outcome of the \{\$Task1\} task. 

If you \{\$Task1Correct\}, \{\$Instructions1\}.

Your partner will observe
\{\$Task1observer\}. They will communicate the outcome to you by clicking a button
that sends a standard message with the result. 

Specifically, if your \{\$Task1noun\}
is correct, you will receive this message: \{\$Task1CorrectMsg\}. 

If your
\{\$Task1noun\} is incorrect, you will receive this message: \{\$Task1IncorrectMsg\}.

Once you have finished reading these instructions, please proceed to the
3-question comprehension quiz on the next screen. For each question you get
right, you will earn \$.05.

\item[Part 1 Quiz Question 1] \hspace{1cm}

\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Feedback: \{Correct/Incorrect.\} In part 1, you will \{\$Task1short\}.

\item[Part 1 Quiz Question 2] \hspace{1cm}
\begin{enumerate}
\setItemnumber{2}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Nothing. 
    \item \$0.50 no matter what. 
    \item It depends on whether you \{\$Task1correct\}.
    \item It depends on whether your partner decides to send you a bonus.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Feedback: \{Correct/Incorrect.\} Your part 1 bonus depends on whether you
\{\$Task1correct\}. If you do so, you will earn \$0.50.

you a message that tells you whether you \{\$Task1correct\}.

\item[Part 1 Quiz Question 4] \hspace{1cm} 
\begin{enumerate} \setItemnumber{4}
\item How much does the messenger get paid for delivering this message?
\begin{enumerate}
\item The messenger [-1: earns a 50 cent bonus if you fail to \{\$Task1correct\} /
-0.1: earns a 5 cent bonus if you fail to \{\$Task1correct\} / 0: does not earn any
money for delivering this message / 0.1: earns a 5 cent bonus if you
\{\$Task1correct\} / 1: earns a 50 cent bonus if you \{\$Task1correct\}].
\item The messenger draws a card which reveals their payment.
\item I will never find out.
\item The messenger gets paid a fixed sum for delivering this message no matter what.
\end{enumerate} 
\end{enumerate}

Feedback: \{Correct/Incorrect.\} The messenger [-1: earns a 50 cent bonus if you
fail to \{\$Task1correct\} / -0.1: earns a 5 cent bonus if you fail to
\{\$Task1correct\} / 0: does not earn any money for delivering this message / 0.1:
earns a 5 cent bonus if you \{\$Task1correct\} / 1: earns a 50 cent bonus if you

    \item[Part 2 Instructions] \hspace{1cm}
    
    Now it is time for \textbf{Part 2} of this task. 
    
    In part 2, you will play three
    games with \{\$Task2PartnerLong\}. Additionally, you will answer some survey
    questions. 
    
    We will describe each of the three games before you play them.
\end{description}

\begin{description}[listparindent = 1.5em]
    \item[Allocation game:]  \hspace{1cm}
    
    In the allocation game, we will give you an extra \$.50. You will decide
    how to allocate this extra money. Specifically, you can keep it all, or you
    can give some or all of it to your partner. Any money you keep will be given
    to you as a bonus, while any money you share will be given to
    \{\$Task2PartnerShort\} as a bonus. 
    
    You will indicate your choice by moving a
    slider that shows how much you wish to give to your partner.

    \item[Spin the wheel game:] \hspace{1cm}
    
In the spin the wheel game, you have the chance to win an additional
    \$0.50 if you predict the outcome of a wheel spin correctly.  
      
    The wheel has ten
    numbers and only one number is the winning one. You pick a number, and if
    the wheel stops at that number, you earn extra \$0.50. Otherwise, you do not
    earn any extra money. We will communicate to you the result of the wheel
    spin at the end of this task. 
    
    You cannot spin the wheel yourself, however.
    Instead, you have to decide who spins the wheel on your behalf. 
    
    Specifically,
    you will have to choose whether you want the computer or your partner,
    \{\$Task2PartnerShort\}, to spin the wheel. 
    
    Do you prefer that the computer or
    your partner, \{\$Task2PartnerShort\}, spin the wheel?

    decisions that you and your partner, \{\$Task2PartnerShort\}, will make. 
    
    You and
    your partner must choose whether to go up or down. 
    
    If you choose to go \textbf{up}:
    
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item and your partner also chooses to go up, each of you gets \$0.40.
    	\item and your partner chooses to go down, you get nothing and your
