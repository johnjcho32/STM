\scriptsize{\item[\hspace{-5mm}] \textit{Note:} Although one experiment (2A, N=150) in John et al. (2019) did include a 2 x 2 design varying a messenger vs. a non-messenger and good vs. bad news like our experimental conditions, they do not calculate the RTM effect nor is the study well-powered to detect differences between the STM and RTM effects. The other experiment (5A, N = 304), does include a neutral message condition to assess valence effects, but no non-messenger conditions necessary to measure the STM and RTM effects.}
